Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.020
========================================================

* Allow undefined values for boolean arguments (and interpret them as "false").
* Fix a few internal signed/unsigned integer mismatches.

Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.019
========================================================

* Fix spelling of two internal functions
* Fix off-by-one error in internal string comparison

Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.018
========================================================

* Fix registering unregistered enums.
* Mark a few tests as known to fail so that they do not abort installation.

Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.017
========================================================

* Register unregistered enums so that, e.g., GSpawnFlags and VtePtyFlags become
  usable.
* Pass on NULL user data in C invocations if appropriate

Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.016
========================================================

* Add support for unicode character arguments to Perl callbacks.
* Avoid misusing the macro PL_na, thus preventing issues when
  Glib::Object::Introspection is used in conjunction with certain XS modules,
  among them XML::Parser and String::Approx.
* Fix build on MinGW with dmake.

Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.015
========================================================

* Add support for array arguments to Perl callbacks.
* Allow Perl code to return Glib::Error objects.
* Register error domains.
* Support conversion to raw structs from unregistered libraries.

Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.014
========================================================

* Implement generic signal marshalling.
* Implement a generic constructor for boxed types and install it as
  Glib::Boxed::new.
* Generate error messages when functions are passed an incorrect number of
  parameters.
* Avoid using vfunc names that coincide with special Perl subs.  This fixes
  double-frees occurring for subclasses of Gtk3::Widget.
* Rework the way fallback vfuncs are installed.
* Correctly marshal out/in-out args when invoking Perl code and fix some other
  related bugs.  This makes it possible to implement complicated interfaces
  such as Gtk3::TreeModel.
* Allow enums and flags to have class functions.
* Add API to manually convert between SVs and enums.
* Plug a few memory leaks.

Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.013
========================================================

* SV -> object: do some type checking
* Fix building with perl <= 5.14
* Convert invalid or void GTypes to undef.

Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.012
========================================================

* Support more struct types when writing fields.
* Handle disguised structures.
* Avoid invalid memory access during callback destruction.
* Use the correct allocator for caller-allocated boxed out-args.
* Add semi-private API wrapping gperl_register_boxed_synonym.

Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.011
========================================================

* Improve handling of boxed unions, like GdkEvent.
* Add support for building the test libs on MSWin32.
* Properly specify our dependencies.

Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.010
========================================================

* Correctly place the linker flags when building the test libs.
* Fix compilation of the test libs against recent gobject-introspection
* updated README file similar to Cairo (RT#74870)
* Created %meta_merge which follows v2 of meta-spec

Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.009
========================================================

* Allow setting boxed fields to undef.
* Do not pass on an incorrect destroy notify func if there is no
  callback.
* Do not crash on inexistent GTypes on perl 5.8.x.

Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.008
========================================================

* When looking up GTypes, also try by name.
* Make constants work on perl 5.8.x.

Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.007
========================================================

* Do not assume filenames are UTF8-encoded; pass the strings on unaltered in
  both directions, C to Perl and Perl to C.  Before passing a filename on to
  something which expects UTF8 (like widgets), users now have to ensure that it
  is UTF8-encoded.  Glib::filename_to_unicode provides one way to do this.

Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.006
========================================================

* Remove an unneeded argument of an internal function
* Plug a leak in the wrapper for constants
* Fix compilation of the test lib on x86-64

Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.005
========================================================

* Use the overloaded '==' operator directly when comparing flags
* Make t/enums.t more robust
* Implement check_gi_version
* Implement test skipping
* Update FSF address in license blurbs

Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.004
========================================================

* Fix building test libraries on Ubuntu 11.10.  They (Ubuntu devs) added
  --as-needed to the default linker flags, and that breaks building the test
  libraries for reasons I don't understand at the moment.  So simply add
  --no-as-needed for now.
* Properly check for definedness throughout; Use gperl_sv_is_defined instead
  of a direct comparison against &PL_sv_undef.

Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.003
========================================================

* Nothing, except for adding the NEWS entries that were forgotten for
  release 0.002.

Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.002
========================================================

* Add support for implementing interfaces.
* Add support for implementing object vfuncs.
* Add support for callbacks in callbacks.
* Add support for caller-allocated out arguments.
* Add support for nested structs.
* Add support for calling functions on structs.
* Add support for reading and writing fields of boxed types.
* Add support for flattening array ref returns.
* Add support for handling 'sentinel booleans'.
* Handle skipping arguments and return values.
* Fix ownership handling for GInitiallyUnowned.
* Expand the documentation.
