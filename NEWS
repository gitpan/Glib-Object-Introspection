Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.004
========================================================

* Fix building test libraries on Ubuntu 11.10.  They (Ubuntu devs) added
  --as-needed to the default linker flags, and that breaks building the test
  libraries for reasons I don't understand at the moment.  So simply add
  --no-as-needed for now.
* Properly check for definedness throughout; Use gperl_sv_is_defined instead
  of a direct comparison against &PL_sv_undef.
